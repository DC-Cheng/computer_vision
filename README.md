# Brief 
OpenCV is a strong and powerful open source computer vision library. 
This is a sample testing repos. 

# Bullet
1. to operate open source computer vision (OpenCV) Library
  - the snnipet will related to filtering operation
  - the snnipet will related to SVM machine
  - the snnipet will related to xml/yml I/O
  - the snnipet will camera calibration
2. to operate kernel image processing using C/C++ operation
  - gaussian filter
  - median filter
  - ... TBC
