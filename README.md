# Brief 

The repos is to show my work-out in computer vision library. The snnipet shows the code in OpenCV example

# Action items

[ OpenCV ]
1. to do image processing with `filtering operation` in OpenCV library. The result is shown as `/result/lena-cmp.png`
2. to do data format IO with `XML/YML` in OpenCV library
3. to do `camera calibration` in OpenCV library. The result is shown as `/result/_1_result.png`

[ Kernel processing ]
1. to run `gaussian filter` in c/c++
2. to run `median filter` in c/c++

[ Qt-GUI ]  
1. SIGNAl, SLOTS, QWidget ...  
2. to vislulize your webcam image in a single button. The result is shown as `/result/qt-gui-1.png`
